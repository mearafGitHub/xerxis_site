          Xexis is Web 3 game platform, leveraging the Ethereum and Cardano blockchain.
          The game is set on a planet called Xerxis, where a mysterious event has unleashed a wave of cosmic energy 
          that transformed the landscape and the inhabitants. Some people gained superpowers, some became mutated monsters, 
          and some remained normal. Thousand years ago a brave cross-planetary travler who discovered the planet, 
          who brought his people, started a civilization and became a king. The planet got itâ€™s name after that king, XEXiS. 
          After the catastrophe, the planet is now divided into factions that fight for survival, resources, and dominance.
